To set a conservation goal, start by going to the Go Low page by clicking on the energy meter icon at the top of this page. Once there, find out your lounge's current consumption for today and see if it's above or below the goal. Then do whatever you can personally to minimize your energy consumption for the remainder of today, and encourage your lounge mates to do the same. See the Go Low page for suggestions on what to do. If you're successful, your lounge will have used less energy than the goal by midnight tonight, and everyone in your lounge will get awarded Kukui Cup points! ",

The inaugural Kukui Cup was held in Fall, 2011 for over 1,000 first year students living in the Hale Aloha residence halls at the University of Hawaii. We are planning the second Kukui Cup for Fall, 2012.  \r\n\r\n##Why is the Kukui Cup important to Hawaii?##\r\nOne of the great challenges facing Hawaii today is our dependence on foreign oil, which negatively affects our security, our economy, our environment, and our next generation's ability to have a healthy, prosperous, sustainable lifestyle. The Kukui Cup raises awareness about Hawaii's oil dependency and how to work toward a better energy future.  \r\n\r\nWe created the following three minute video to help explain why we believe energy issues are so important to Hawaii.    \r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<div class=\"video-container video-wrapper2 tabbed\">\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" style=\"max-width: 500px;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/EJc0mXS7JCo\"\r\n                frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>\r\n</center>   \r\n\r\n##How it works##\r\nStudents participating in the Kukui Cup challenge can login to the website during the challenge to gain access about their current power consumption and cumulative energy use. The site also provides short videos developed specifically for the competition that provide insight into Hawaii energy issues, and students can earn points by correctly answering questions about each video's content. Other ways to earn points include meeting a daily energy conservation goal, attending short, interactive \"workshops\" about energy, or going on excursions to power plants, wind farms, and more. Participation can lead to prizes including t-shirts, pizza parties, and gift certificates. By playing the game, students become knowledgeable about the energy challenges facing Hawaii and how to change their own behavior and those around them to use energy more efficiently.  \r\n\r\nThe following two minute video was used in 2011 to introduce students to the Kukui Cup; it is one of the first things they watched after logging in to the website:  \r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<div class=\"video-container video-wrapper2\">\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" style=\"max-width: 500px;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/T37kNTkZCrA\"\"\r\n                frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>\r\n</center>  \r\n\r\n##For more information##\r\nFor more information, please go to <a href=\"http://kukuicup.org\">kukuicup.org</a>.  \r\n  \r\n"

Not much unless you're renegade architect Michael Reynolds, in which case they are tools of choice for producing thermal mass and energy-independent housing. For 30 years New Mexico-based Reynolds and his green disciples have devoted their time to advancing the art of \"Earthship Biotecture\" by building self-sufficient, off-the-grid communities where design and function converge in eco-harmony. However, these experimental structures that defy state standards create conflict between Reynolds and the authorities, who are backed by big business. Frustrated by antiquated legislation, Reynolds lobbies for the right to create a sustainable living test site. While politicians hum and ha, Mother Nature strikes, leaving communities devastated by tsunamis and hurricanes. Reynolds and his crew seize the opportunity to lend their pioneering skills to those who need it most.

Every lounge is assigned a daily energy goal that represents a 5% reduction in electricity use from what the lounge was using before the competition. The Energy Goal Game shows how much energy your lounge has used so far today, and how that compares to the energy goal. The game also shows some activities that might be helpful in getting your lounge to reduce its energy use.\r\n\r\nFor this activity, you will check out the [Go Low](/energy) page.

To do this, you will need a large container with a known volume (like a water bottle or bucket) that you can fill in the shower, and a clock of some type (like your watch or cell phone). Make sure to not get your clock wet if it isn't waterproof!\r\n\r\nHold the container up to the shower head, turn on the shower faucet to the level you use normally when showering, and note the time on the clock (or use a stopwatch). Watch the container fill, and note the time when it is completely full of water.\r\n\r\nNow you know the volume of water that the shower put out, and the amount of time it was running. From these two values, you can compute the flow rate of your shower by dividing the volume by the number of seconds it took to fill. For example, if you filled a 1 gallon bucket and it took 30 seconds, then the flow rate is 2 gallons per minute.\r\n\r\nAs you will see, water comes out of shower heads pretty fast, which is why it is important to turn off the water when you aren't actively using it, like while soaping up."

The art should have some relationship to the theme of the Kukui Cup: use your imagination. To receive credit for this activity, take a picture of it (preferably at night) and include some text describing what your art is about. The more amazing, creative, and energy-related your window art, the more points you can earn. Since you still want to save energy, we recommend that you light up your art between 9-9:15 PM, you don't need to keep it lit all night long.\r\n\r\nAnother way to get more points for this activity is to enlist your neighbors beside you, above you, or below you to create a coordinated group window art effort. Take a photo of all of the windows, then tell us in the description which one is yours.\r\n\r\nThe more awesome your art, the closer to 50 points you'll earn.\r\n"

To do this, you will need a large container with a known volume (like a water bottle or bucket) that you can fit in the sink, and a clock of some type (like your watch or cell phone). Make sure to keep your clock dry if it isn't waterproof!\r\n\r\nHold the container up to the faucet in the sink, turn on the water to the level you use normally when using the sink, and note the time on the clock (or use a stopwatch). Watch the container fill, and note the time when it is completely full of water.\r\n\r\nNow you know the volume of water that the sink put out, and the amount of time it was running. From these two values, you can compute the flow rate of your sink by dividing the volume by the number of seconds it took to fill. For example, if you filled a 1 gallon bucket and it took 30 seconds, then the flow rate is 2 gallons per minute.\r\n\r\nAs you will see, water comes out of faucets pretty fast, which is why it is important to turn off the water when you aren't actively using it, like while brushing your teeth."

Note that this activity will require significantly more effort than normal activities, but it is also worth more points. This activity is worth a variable number of points, so the more effort and the higher quality of your photo blog, the more points you will receive.\r\n\r\nA photo blog is a series of photographs on a particular subject, possibly with some explanatory text on each photo. You will need to find a place to host your photo blog, some options are: [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/), or [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com/). Remember to pick a theme for your photos related to the Kukui Cup. Here are some starter ideas:\r\n\r\n* Pictures of things using electricity across campus\r\n* Pictures of energy generators (harder to find)\r\n* Pictures of trash across campus (litter, recycling, dumpsters)\r\n* Pictures of the different types of lighting used across campus\r\n* Or something else Kukui Cup-related"

Have an hour to walk around campus and learn about UH energy and sustainability projects? Then you're all set!\r\n\r\nHere's the deal: you'll use your smartphone (and your own smarts) to follow a trail of clues around campus and discover eight different locations related to energy or sustainability. Each location is tagged with a special Kukui Cup sign so you'll know when you've found it. Once there, take a picture of yourself with the sign in the background for verification, and upload to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/). You will earn 5 Kukui Cup points for each location you find.  The sign also contains a URL that you can retrieve to obtain directions to the next location.\r\n\r\nReady?  Here's the first clue (you'll want to open it on your smartphone): [http://goo.gl/psXER](http://goo.gl/psXER)\r\n\r\nWhen you are done, come back here, click **I Did This!** and provide us with a link to your Flickr account so we can verify your trek."

The rules are simple. You are going to add a photo of yourself to the end of the chain of photos in the [Flickr Kukui Cup 2011 Photo Chain Game group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/kukuicup-2011-photo-chain-game/).  Each photo contains:\r\n\r\n1. yourself in some kind of \"pose\"\r\n2. you holding or wearing some Kukui Cup item (t-shirt, water bottle, eco-tote, or tumbler)\r\n\r\nTo make the sequence of photos a chain, your photo must \"match\" the preceding photo posted to the group with respect to either the pose, the location, or the Kukui Cup item.\r\n\r\nThe caption to each photo should list the pose, the location, and the item.\r\n\r\nHere's how you do it:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the [Flickr Kukui Cup 2011 Photo Chain Game group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/kukuicup-2011-photo-chain-game/). See what photo is at the end of the list.\r\n2. Take a photo of yourself in a way that extends the chain (match either the pose, location, or item)\r\n3. Upload your photo to your own Flickr account (creating it if necessary).\r\n4. Go back to the [Flickr Kukui Cup 2011 Photo Chain Game group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/kukuicup-2011-photo-chain-game/), and \"join\" the group. \r\n5. Click \"Add Photos\" and select your photo. \r\n6. Provide a title, such as \"Photo Chain Game 12\" (or whatever the next number is in the chain).\r\n7. Provide a caption that indicates: pose, location, item, and which of the three matches.\r\n8. Save.\r\n9. Click **I Did This!** button and tell us your Flickr name so we can confirm your upload to the group and award your points."

All you need to do is have the new user enter your email address on the new \"Referral Bonus\" page during their initial login.   Both you and they will earn 10 extra points as soon as the new user earns 30 points with regular game play. There is **NO LIMIT** to the number of times you can earn a referral bonus, so start signing up your friends now!\r\n\r\nTo help you get started, you can earn five extra points for one of your referrals by completing this activity. Just type in the email address of the new user you brought to the Kukui Cup in the box below. You will get your five points after the new user gets to 30 points.\r\n\r\nNote that while this activity is just a one-shot deal, the referral bonus feature that it introduces you to can be done repeatedly.  You do not have to wait for your first referral to complete before getting new referrals.   Nor do you have to even do this activity at all in order to get referral bonuses.  So, go out there, get as many new players to sign up and enter your email as possible, and you will get 10 points each time they achieve 30 points.  (You can even coach them through their first 30 points to make sure they get a proper introduction to the game).    "
